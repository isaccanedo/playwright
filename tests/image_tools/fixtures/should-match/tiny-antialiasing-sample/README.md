# Tiny anti-aliasing sample

This is a 10x10 image sample with a 3 anti-aliased pixels in-between. This is actually
a cropped down snapshot of one of the [ubuntu-x86-vs-ubuntu-arm samples](../ubuntu-x86-vs-ubuntu-arm/samples/stylings_stories-Stylings-stories-Texture-bar-should-use-custom-path-chrome/stylings-stories/texture/bar/should-use-custom-path-actual.png) handy for debugging
purposes.
